# pinta-browser
This repo shows stages of creating my own browser with Python. Pinta comes from The Pinta Island tortoise, 
an extinct subspecies of Gal√°pagos tortoise native to Ecuador's Pinta Island. 
See more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinta_Island_tortoise.
## Main Features
The idea is inspired by the Arc Browser (https://arc.net/) and my need to switch from MacOS to Linux on which 
this browser is not available. The main features I want to have are:
- split view: several tabs opened in parallel (side-by-side)
- integrated bookmarks/tabs sidebar
  - autosaving all changes to json file
  - sidebar spaces
  - pinned bookmarks
  - easy to CRUD bookmarks
- firefox/chrome plugins 
- free forever
## Pre-Alpha
The browser is in deep pre-alpha stage, it is possible that I will switch to different engine (currently QtWebEngine is used). 
Tested on MacOS Ventura 13.5 (22G74) only with Python 3.9.13.
## Installation and usage
`pipenv install`

`pipenv shell`

`python ./pintaXX.py`

XX - chosen version number of the browser.
